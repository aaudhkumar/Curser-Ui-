# 🚀 Cursor Landing Page Clone (Assignment Project)

This project is a desktop-first recreation of the official Cursor developer tool landing page, built using only HTML and CSS as part of a frontend assignment.

The main objective of this project is to closely match the visual structure, layout, typography, and color scheme of the original website.
